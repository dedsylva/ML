# Linear Regression 

## Description
Linear Regression is the goto for tackling the problem you encounter for the first time. As a physics major, I found that to be true for nature as well. If you don't know how/where to begin, this is the place for you. Try a Linear Regression on your dataset (or, if you're solving a Physics problem, expand your function in first order Taylor Series).

### Questions
- Does the implementation of Adam Optimizer makes the regression better or we should just use the vanilla approach (aka Gradient Descent)? Let's find out!

## TODO
* Vanilla Regression (Gradient Descent) [x]
* Metrics for valuating model [x]
* Nice plotting []
* Adam Optimizer, aka changing learning rate and doing the moving average on the mean and variance of the distribution (whatever that means) []
