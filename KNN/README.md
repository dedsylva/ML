# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Description
KNN is a classification algorithm that chooses what class an input has based on its (euclidean) distance to their k-neighbors.
The main.py program creates a random dataset and calculates the class of an input (also random), while printing the current distribution, with the input, the K-Nearest Neighbors considered in the calculation, and the rest of the dataset.

## How to use
```python
#K, SIZE, NUMBER OF CLASSES

python3 knn.py 3 10 2 #default
```

## TODO
* Iterative printing (funcAnimation is annoying)

### Implementations
- Vanilla [x]
- Centroid []
