# Naive Bayes - Applying Bayes Theorem to Predict Classes

## Descriptpion
The Naive Bayes algorithm is the implementation of Bayes Theorem (Conditional Probability) to predicting (multi) classes. It's main characteristic is the independency of features. This means that when predicting if a given fruit is an apple, this model would say that being red and round are independent characteristics (which in reality they're not).
